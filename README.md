# hello-world
Just getting to know how to use Github
Hi people!

It's me a newbie trying to navigate through the world of codes. 
It's a huge world with lots of things to learn that without keeping track or having an interest you might end up feeling lost.
But I'd rather loose myself in a code. Maybe I will end up turning into a cyborg. 
I think that will be cool
